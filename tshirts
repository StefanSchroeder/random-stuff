== You can show everybody your appreciation for i3wm by wearing our t-shirt

The i3wm-team is collaborating with a shirt manufacturer in Germany
that provides high quality t-shirts with a cool i3wm logo.

Since the website is in German only, we want to help with your order
in case that German is not your primary language.

=== The shirt

The shirt is black, has white text and a light blue i3wm-logo. It is
available in eight sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL, XXXXL).


=== The order process for new customers

Goto
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.freddruck.de
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the navigation bar on the left, select 'i3-tiling window manager'.

Select the link below the shirt of your choice. (At the time of
this writing only black was available.)

On the next page you can select the size (Gr&ouml;&szlig;e) and
the number of shirts (=Anzahl) of that size you want to order.

Add to cart by clicking 'in den Korb'.

In the upper right corner click 'Kasse' (checkout).

You now have to register with the freddruck-website. Click
"Weiter" below the left white box titled "Neuer Kunde" 
(new customer).

On the next page you have to supply your personal information:

Vorname (First name)

Nachname (Last name)

Geburtsdatum (Birth date, format DD.MM.YYYY)

Firmenname (company name if applicable)

Address

Strasse/Nr. (Street and Number)

Postleitzahl (ZIP code)

Ort (City)

Land (Country) (Bitte w&auml;hlen=Please choose)

Telefonnummer (Phone number, don't forget your country code)

Telefaxnummber (Fax)

Newsletter is a checkbox.

Passwort (Password)

Best&auml;tigung (Confirmation)

Then click 'Weiter' (Continue).

On the next page you should get the confirmation
that your account was successfully created. ("Ihr Konto wurde mit Erfolg er√∂ffnet!")

You will also get a confirmation email about the
creation of the account (that's not your order yet!).

Click "Weiter" (Next) to continue.

On the next page you can review your destination address.

The text field allows you to add a comment. I am not exactly 
sure what to use it for. 

Click "Weiter" again, to choose the payment options.

On the payment page you can choose your method of payment:

Offered are

* Check (to be sent in advance)
* Paypal
* on pickup

Since I can't do any of those three, I have to give up. Too bad.
American's are used to be able to pay with CC. So am I.

On the next page you can finally confirm your order.

The payment by Paypal has to be commited in advance as well, but it's
unclear where to send it to; I am not a Paypal user and will never be.
